# RestAssuredPractice
Rest APIs practice tests

This project deals with testing of the 4 mostly used HTTP Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE using Rest Assured Library.
Have used ReqRes demo endpoints for the GET request and for the remaining ones have used a mock server (localhost) using node modules featuring an employee data json file.
Have used method references feature of JAVA 8 for printing out data on console.
Have explored the various ways of constructing a POST request body under POSTRequest.java test
Have primarily used Lombok features to remove the boilerplate codes while constructing the POJO class for Employee.
